# Robocode
Artificial Intelligence Coursework

The AI coursework consisted in utilizing a well-known programming game called Robocode to show our understanding of AI methodologies. 
The game consists of a robot that is able to move and attack freely in a 2D environment. The game contains its own laws of physics which the
robots must obey such as acceleration of bullets/robots.
The agent then faces off against other students' agents as opponents in an arena-type environment and the victor is the last agent standing.
